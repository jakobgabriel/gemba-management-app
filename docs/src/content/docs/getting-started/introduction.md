## What is Gemba Management?

The **Gemba Management System** is a shopfloor manufacturing management platform designed to digitize and streamline daily operations on the factory floor. "Gemba" (現場) is the Japanese term for "the actual place" — in manufacturing, it refers to the shopfloor where value is created.

## Problem Statement

Manufacturing plants rely on paper-based or fragmented digital processes for:

- **Issue tracking** — problems reported verbally or on whiteboards, lost between shifts
- **Production logging** — handwritten hourly tallies, transcribed later into spreadsheets
- **Safety management** — physical safety crosses on walls, no historical data
- **Gemba walks** — clipboard-based observations with no standardized scoring

This leads to data loss, delayed escalations, and lack of visibility for plant leadership.

## Solution

The Gemba Management System provides a unified digital platform covering:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Issue Management** | Create, escalate (L1→L2→L3), and resolve issues with full audit trails |
| **Production Tracking** | Hourly data entry per workstation with actual vs. target comparison |
| **Safety Cross** | Daily shift safety status with calendar views and accident counters |
| **Gemba Walks** | Structured 5-step (SQDCP) observation process with scoring |
| **Analytics** | Dashboards, trend analysis, and AI-assisted queries |
| **Multi-language** | 15 languages supported for global manufacturing operations |

## User Roles

The system supports four hierarchical roles:

1. **Team Member (L1)** — Creates issues, logs production data, records safety status
2. **Area Leader (L2)** — Manages escalated issues, conducts Gemba walks, reviews area data
3. **Plant Manager (L3)** — Plant-wide visibility, analytics, final escalation level
4. **Admin** — System configuration, user management, plant/area/team setup
